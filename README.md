# 🐍 Retro Snake
A retro-style **Snake game** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, inspired by classic pixel arcade games.
The goal of this project was to deeply understand **grid-based game logic**, **game loops**, and **DOM-based rendering**, while keeping a clean retro pixel aesthetic.
